<h2 align="center">Blazewind - An Open Source Blazor Admin Template</h2>

<h4 align="center">:warning: Work in Progress :warning:</h4>

This project is a Blazor WebAssembly hosted dashboard template that combines the power of MudBlazor and Tailwind CSS.
It serves as an excellent starting point for building interactive dashboards. Notably, there are currently limited options for MudBlazor-based templates,
so this project aims to fill that gap and inspire the Blazor community to create more open-source dashboard templates.
